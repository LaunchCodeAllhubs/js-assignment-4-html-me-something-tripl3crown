      <h5>Nara</h5>
      <p>"Nara presents us with a delightful and extraordinary opportunity to interact with deer in a way that feels magical and impossible in the US. The residents' respectful and kind treatment of the deer allows them to fearlessly approach and be petted by humans. Their friendliness is heartwarming, and they often bow their heads in appreciation after receiving treats from visitors and tourists."</p>
